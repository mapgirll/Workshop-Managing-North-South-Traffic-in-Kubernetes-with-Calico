# Managing North/South Traffic in Kubernetes with Calico

## Welcome

In this Calico workshop, you will work with Calico, Calico Whisker, and Calico Cloud Free Tier to learn how manage ingress and egress traffic in your cluster, keeping security in mind.  

Requiring access to services inside is almost a universal need, and often Kubernetes services need to talk to external services as well. Managing incoming traffic allows you to manage service resources, ensure they don't become overloaded and are routed to the correct backend services, and that the inbound traffic is secure. Managing egress access ensures your services are only able to talk to trusted, known endpoints. Additionally this gives you the ability to provide static IP addresses for outbound traffic.

Calico enables fine-grained, secure workload access controls between your microservices and external databases, cloud services, APIs, and other applications. It also prevents the lateral movement of threats with identity-aware segmentation that works across all of your workload environments, including hosts, VMs, Kubernetes components, and services.

You will come away from this workshop with an understanding of how others in your industry are securing and observing cloud-native applications with Calico, along with best practices that you can implement in your organization.
